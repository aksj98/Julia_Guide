## CLI
The cli folder in the Julia repository contains the code for the Julia command line interface (CLI). This is the interface that users interact with when they launch the Julia REPL (read-eval-print loop) or run Julia scripts from the command line. The Julia CLI is responsible for parsing and evaluating user input, printing output, and handling any errors that may occur during evaluation. It also provides various command-line options and flags that users can use to customize the behavior of the Julia REPL or scripts.
