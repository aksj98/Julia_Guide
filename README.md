# Julia_Guide
Beginner guide for Julia code

The repository gives overviews of what each folder does and what each subfolder inside each folder does
## CLI
The cli folder in the Julia repository contains the code for the Julia command line interface (CLI). This is the interface that users interact with when they launch the Julia REPL (read-eval-print loop) or run Julia scripts from the command line. The Julia CLI is responsible for parsing and evaluating user input, printing output, and handling any errors that may occur during evaluation. It also provides various command-line options and flags that users can use to customize the behavior of the Julia REPL or scripts.

## Base
In the Julia repository, the base folder contains the source code for the standard library for the Julia programming language. The standard library includes a wide variety of functions and data types that are available by default in Julia, including support for basic operations such as arithmetic, data manipulation, and input/output. The code in the base folder is organized into subfolders by topic, with each subfolder containing code related to a specific area of functionality.

## .devcontainer
The .devcontainer folder in the Julia repository is used to set up a development environment for working on the Julia codebase using Visual Studio Code's Remote - Containers extension. This extension allows you to use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. The .devcontainer folder contains configuration files that are used to set up the development environment, including the Dockerfile that specifies the base image to use and any additional dependencies that should be installed in the container.

To use the development environment, you will need to have Visual Studio Code and the Remote - Containers extension installed on your local machine. With these tools, you can open the Julia repository in a containerized development environment by clicking the "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container" command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P). This will build the container using the configuration files in the .devcontainer folder and then open the Julia repository in a new Visual Studio Code window running inside the container.

## .github
The .github folder in the Julia repository is used to store files that are related to the management and maintenance of the repository, including files for continuous integration (CI) and issue and pull request templates.

Here is a list of some of the files and directories that you might find in the .github folder:

ISSUE_TEMPLATE: This directory contains templates for issues that users can use to report bugs or request new features.

PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE: This directory contains templates for pull requests that contributors can use when submitting changes to the repository.

workflows: This directory contains configuration files for GitHub Actions workflows, which are used to automate tasks such as building and testing the code, releasing new versions, and more.

CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: This file contains the code of conduct for the Julia community, which outlines the expectations for behavior and the consequences for failing to follow the code.

CONTRIBUTING.md: This file contains guidelines for contributing to the Julia repository, including information on how to submit issues and pull requests, how to write good commit messages, and more.
