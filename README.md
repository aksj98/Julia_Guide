# Julia_Guide
Beginner guide for Julia code for developers

The repository gives overviews of what each folder does and what each subfolder inside each folder does
## CLI
The cli folder in the Julia repository contains the code for the Julia command line interface (CLI). This is the interface that users interact with when they launch the Julia REPL (read-eval-print loop) or run Julia scripts from the command line. The Julia CLI is responsible for parsing and evaluating user input, printing output, and handling any errors that may occur during evaluation. It also provides various command-line options and flags that users can use to customize the behavior of the Julia REPL or scripts.

## Base
In the Julia repository, the base folder contains the source code for the standard library for the Julia programming language. The standard library includes a wide variety of functions and data types that are available by default in Julia, including support for basic operations such as arithmetic, data manipulation, and input/output. The code in the base folder is organized into subfolders by topic, with each subfolder containing code related to a specific area of functionality.

## .devcontainer
The .devcontainer folder in the Julia repository is used to set up a development environment for working on the Julia codebase using Visual Studio Code's Remote - Containers extension. This extension allows you to use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. The .devcontainer folder contains configuration files that are used to set up the development environment, including the Dockerfile that specifies the base image to use and any additional dependencies that should be installed in the container.

To use the development environment, you will need to have Visual Studio Code and the Remote - Containers extension installed on your local machine. With these tools, you can open the Julia repository in a containerized development environment by clicking the "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container" command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P). This will build the container using the configuration files in the .devcontainer folder and then open the Julia repository in a new Visual Studio Code window running inside the container.

## .github
The .github folder in the Julia repository is used to store files that are related to the management and maintenance of the repository, including files for continuous integration (CI) and issue and pull request templates.

Here is a list of some of the files and directories that you might find in the .github folder:

ISSUE_TEMPLATE: This directory contains templates for issues that users can use to report bugs or request new features.

PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE: This directory contains templates for pull requests that contributors can use when submitting changes to the repository.

workflows: This directory contains configuration files for GitHub Actions workflows, which are used to automate tasks such as building and testing the code, releasing new versions, and more.

CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: This file contains the code of conduct for the Julia community, which outlines the expectations for behavior and the consequences for failing to follow the code.

CONTRIBUTING.md: This file contains guidelines for contributing to the Julia repository, including information on how to submit issues and pull requests, how to write good commit messages, and more.

## contrib
The contrib folder in the Julia repository is used to store code for optional packages that are not part of the Julia standard library. These packages are developed and maintained by the Julia community, and they provide additional functionality that is not included in the base distribution of Julia.

The contrib folder is organized into subfolders, each of which contains the source code for a specific package. The packages in the contrib folder can be installed by users using the Julia package manager.

It's worth noting that not all optional packages for Julia are stored in the contrib folder. Some packages are hosted on external websites or version control systems, and they may be installed using the Julia package manager by specifying the URL or repository location.

## deps
The deps folder in the Julia repository is used to store source code and build scripts for external dependencies that are required by Julia. These dependencies are typically libraries written in other programming languages (such as C or Fortran) that provide functionality that is used by Julia.

The deps folder is organized into subfolders, each of which contains the source code and build scripts for a specific dependency. The build scripts in the deps folder are used to build the dependencies from source when Julia is built or installed.

It's worth noting that the deps folder is not used to store the compiled binary versions of the dependencies. Instead, the compiled binaries are stored in the usr folder, which is located at the root of the Julia repository. The usr folder is used to store compiled binaries and other resources that are included in the Julia distribution.

## doc
The doc folder in the Julia repository is used to store documentation for the Julia programming language and its standard library. This documentation includes user guides, API reference documentation, and other resources that are intended to help users learn how to use Julia and its various features.

The doc folder is organized into subfolders, each of which contains documentation for a specific area of functionality. The documentation is written in a simple markup language called Markdown, which can be easily converted to HTML or other formats for display on the web or in other applications.

The Julia documentation is built using the Documenter package, which is a tool for generating documentation from source code and other documentation sources. The Documenter configuration files and templates are also stored in the doc folder.

## etc
The etc folder in the Julia repository is used to store miscellaneous configuration files and resources that are used by Julia or its build process. The contents of the etc folder can vary, but some of the files and directories that you might find in this folder include:

LICENSE.md: This file contains the license for Julia, which specifies the terms under which the software can be used and distributed.

Make.user: This file is used to specify additional build options or overrides for the Julia build process. Users can create this file in the Julia root directory to specify custom build options without modifying the main Julia build scripts.

gitattributes: This file is used to specify Git-specific attributes for files in the Julia repository.

gitignore: This file is used to specify files or patterns that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes to the repository.

CITATION.md: This file contains information on how to cite Julia in academic publications.

Overall, the etc folder is a catch-all location for miscellaneous configuration files and resources that are used by Julia or its build process.

## src
The src folder in the Julia repository is used to store the source code for the Julia programming language. This source code includes the implementation of the Julia language itself, as well as the standard library and core packages that are distributed with Julia.

The src folder is organized into subfolders, each of which contains the source code for a specific component of Julia. Some of the subfolders that you might find in the src folder include:

base: This folder contains the source code for the Julia standard library, which provides a wide variety of functions and data types that are available by default in Julia.

compiler: This folder contains the source code for the Julia compiler, which is responsible for turning Julia source code into machine code that can be executed by the computer.

stdlib: This folder contains the source code for the core packages that are distributed with Julia, including packages for basic operations such as arithmetic and data manipulation.

Overall, the src folder is an important part of the Julia repository, as it contains the source code for the Julia programming language and its core components.

## stdlib
The stdlib folder in the Julia repository is used to store the source code for the core packages that are distributed with Julia. These packages provide a wide variety of functionality that is available by default in Julia, including support for basic operations such as arithmetic, data manipulation, and input/output.

The stdlib folder is organized into subfolders, each of which contains the source code for a specific package. Some of the packages that you might find in the stdlib folder include:

LinearAlgebra: This package provides functions for linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, linear system solving, and singular value decomposition.

Random: This package provides functions for generating random numbers and data using a variety of probability distributions.

Statistics: This package provides functions for statistical analysis, including functions for calculating basic statistics, fitting probability distributions, and performing hypothesis tests.

Dates: This package provides functions for working with dates and times, including functions for formatting and parsing date strings and for performing calculations with dates.

## test
The test folder in the Julia repository is used to store test cases and test utilities for the Julia programming language and its standard library. Test cases are small programs that are written to verify that a piece of code is working correctly. They are an important part of the development process, as they help to ensure that the code is reliable and free of bugs.

The test folder is organized into subfolders, each of which contains test cases and test utilities for a specific area of functionality. Some of the subfolders that you might find in the test folder include:

base: This folder contains test cases for the functions and data types in the Julia standard library.

compiler: This folder contains test cases for the Julia compiler.

stdlib: This folder contains test cases for the core packages that are distributed with Julia.

The test cases in the test folder are written using the Test module, which is a part of the Julia standard library. The Test module provides functions for writing and running test cases, as well as functions for reporting the results of the tests.
